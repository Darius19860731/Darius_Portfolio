    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a Computer Science student, I‚Äôm excited to share that I have completed several courses. The curriculum included Programming with Python and JavaScript, as well as projects developed with HTML and CSS. In Software Engineering, I completed a hands-on project that involved comprehensive planning, from architecture documentation to the development of a web application. Currently, I am working on a webshop for ButcherBlocks, inspired by my brother, who is a carpenter. I believe he should explore online business opportunities, and this project gives me valuable experience. 

Additionally, I have learned about algorithmics and the significance of Big O notation. My studies in data analytics and data science have provided me with a solid understanding of both theoretical and practical concepts in these areas, including machine learning. I also explored Big Data technologies and gained insights into cyber security and data protection.

For one of my projects, I created a Computer Science project using TensorFlow‚Äîa predictive analytics model designed to forecast athletes' training routines. This was a complex yet enjoyable task, and I take great satisfaction in seeing the results of my hard work. 

I must also mention my love for PyCharm and the JetBrains Professional edition, which make my coding experience much more manageable..</p>
